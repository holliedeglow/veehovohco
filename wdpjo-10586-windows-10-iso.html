Will the setup copy all necessary files Hi there. I run a tiny little electronics and PC service facility and I'd like to share my experiences with you! Windows 10 November Update, also known as version 1511, 10586, upgrades appear to be going smoothly for the most part. I've upgraded about 50 machines so far in The Mad Scientist's Lair / Andrew's Electronics, some from as far back as 2007.

I'm attempting to make a boot image for VMware vms. I'm following the instructions here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sccm/osd/get-started/customize-boot-images (using WinPE 5 instructions, but substituting the paths for 10 since there doesn't seem to be any 10 specific instructions). When it comes time to import the boot image, I'm getting the following error in SCCM after it attempt to import it: • You can not import this boot image. Only finalized boot images are supported. Thanks to user The_MAZZTer, we now know why MS pulled 10586 isos, and the good news is it is back. http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/11/windows-10-november-update-was-pulled-for-forgetting-privacy-settings-its-now-back/. 
I got my laptop with Windows 10 RTM(Build 10240) a few months ago,and the first thing I did was to disable auto updates.Now I want to update to version 1511 (Build 10586),but windows update says that my pc is up to date. PS:I know that I can download the iso,but I want to update via Windows Update. Edit:I decided to install Hi All, PC Partpicker List (https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/user/perrymanon/builds/#view=QfQV3C) Version 1511 (OS Build 10586.164) Windows 10 Pro Full Speccy Link ( Imgur ( bit of a strange error going on with my Windows 10 install. This install was done as an upgrade from a Windows 7 Pro, however the upgrade was done using an ISO on a memory stick as the windows update upgrade would not work, don't It is recommended that you should not install Insider Versions as your main OS, but if you want to try them, how do you do that but retain existing release version of Windows 10? Several options exist:- In all cases, it is advisable to make an image backup of current install e.g. using Macrium Reflect Free before installing the Insider version. You can either install second copy of version 10586, join Insider Program and upgrade to latest version, or you can install latest Slow Ring version. I have this strange thing happening: Every time I start new Windows 10 Pro machine it uses 100% CPU and ton of RAM until I disable Windows P2P updates (no matter what image I use: Dell image/system out of the box or system installed using native MS ISO). What is more interesting it only happens when system is connected to corporate LAN/WiFi network (Windows AD, DHCP, DNS), even before I connect system to AD. Issue applies to different hardware platforms, so I don't think it's HW is related. I'm on the fast ring of the Win10 insider program since its inception, and recently I've had issues updating. I had to download the ISO to jump to 14372, and then I got up to 14385, and now it is stuck here. It finds the updates, downloads them, when it starts rebooting to install it eventually boots back to the desktop and is stuck on 14385. I can't find error logs, or find out what went wrong. C:$WINDOWS.~BT shows up as 3.03GB when the update is preparing, its down to 64MB after the failed. I installed the Windows 10 Anniversary Update last night using the upgrade ISO from Microsoft. After the initial restart I noticed the applications that usually start on boot up were a bit slow to pop up but outside of that everything was running smoothly. I began downloading the Halo 5: Forge bundle to take a look at it and i believe it's total size is 35~GB. I stopped monitoring the download at 15GB and called it a night. Woke up this morning to find the download window displaying 16.20GB. I got my laptop with Windows 10 RTM(Build 10240) a few months ago,and the first thing I did was to disable auto updates.Now I want to update to version 1511 (Build 10586),but windows update says that my pc is up to date. PS:I know that I can download the iso,but I want to update via Windows Update. Edit:Downloading I did get this message when update installs at end after preparation of updates was finished on my gaming computer. There were problems installing some updates, but we'll try again later. If you keep seeing this and want to search the web or contact support for information, this may help: But when I checked in Event Viewer, it did pop up error code 0x80070003, 0x8024200D and 0x8024001E (this error code did not happen again). It was mostly two first error codes did pop up. That's strange EDIT: Well that was stupid. All I did was uninstall the Windows 10 ADK and reinstalled it from the same executable that I never deleted off my desktop from a few months back. Feelin' lucky, I just updated the same share I've always used. Now it works great! I can't seem to get my Windows 10 Pro VL image to work with MDT. Last year, I converted my colleagues into MDT believers by setting up a deployment share for our Windows 7 image that can be PXE booted. I don't have anything fancy 
I'm trying to upgrade two HP Pavilion a1528x ( machines, currently running Windows 8.1 Pro 32-bit just fine, to Windows 10.

Hello, So it all began with running a couple of games and getting a "Display driver has stopped working message" during gaming. Then playing Overwatch and it started closing the application, because it could not find the rendering device. I was told to run SFC Scan to see if I had any corrupt files. So I rank Sfc /Scannow and it came back with windows resource protection found corrupt files. Then I ran /RestoreHealth and it said it was 100% fixed and complete so I restarted it and ran sfc /Scan. So recently, on the 5th I believe, I turned on my computer to discover that my start menu wouldn't open and neither would the action center or the search bar/cortana. I also could not access the accounts page in settings, it just wouldn't load. I could do this in other user accounts but not my main one. I ended up using an iso to do an in-place upgrade over my first windows 10 installation and everything was fine (if very sluggish when launching things from search and start), until it started.
