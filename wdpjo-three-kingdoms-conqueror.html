This was around the time I discovered BookTube and I followed a bunch of YA channels. I marked every YA book mentioned as to-be-read. Fun times. This led to me visiting a lot of YA books' pages on Goodreads and I noticed two things: (1) YA books have much higher ratings compared to books in the adult age range and (2)the sequels in the series. Sorry for the lazy video today Follow Lord Zero: https://twitter.com/BR0_TV?s=09. As game 2 is only getting Lord Packs (I’m hoping those Campaign Packs are saved for Game 3), it seems logical to make a thread discussing what these could be (and what we would mostly want out of them). I’ll use this thread to make the two I would specifically like to see. Of course, add your own ideas below (I’m shorting down the lore pieces for size and quicker reading-I’ll link the Wiki if you want to read up on the character or unit).

The biggest reason why I think Gendry is going to end up on the throne is that, the founder of House Baratheon, Orys, was a bastard. Well, actually he was just “rumoured” to be a Targaryen bastard. Storm’s End was given to him by his ‘brother’ Aegon the Conqueror. Now, he is Valyrian, and that means Gendry has the blood of the dragon. Like Orys, Gendry’s parentage (or at least one parent) seems to be of a mystery. We only know that his father was Robert but who is his mother? And I doubt.

Hey, me again. You may remember me from such things as my attempt to make Pinyin comprehensible (https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/bkj4r5/romanisation_of_the_three_kingdoms_a_super_basic/). I know a lot of people out there still don't know a whole lot about the Three Kingdoms, Romance or otherwise. But knowing who these characters are is part of the appeal – which is why CA have put so much effort into character this time around. I thought I'd try to explain some of the background. This is the 2nd stage of the Battle of Guan Du stages (I'm using Normal Difficulty) in Campaign mode and the 2nd stage is basically during the Battle Hi Reddit, How will Game of Thrones end? It may sound unlikely, but I’m pretty convinced Game of Thrones will end like the Bible ends. George Martin had a catholic upbringing, and considers himself a “lapsed catholic”, an atheist. Could he have based the main arc of the story on the apocalyptic end of the Bible? Listen to this. The Bible ends with the Book of Revelation. It’s an apocalyptic text that has been massively influential, and is the very origin of concepts such as armageddon 3 Kingdoms Conqueror. 632 likes. We Conquer all country within I have never been one invest in extreme tinfoil theories, and though the title and nature of this post may initially suggest such extremity, there are enough curious parallels between certain distant, unrelated, yet otherwise widespread and foundational elements of A Song of Ice and Fire to warrant this consideration and discussion.

I know what we've seen last episode could still wrap up differently, but I am now almost certain that Dany is going mad and will be killed, either by Jon or Jaime. That's my guess. But I also want to give my two cents on why I think the show is going about this the wrong way. I also want to share some thoughts on Dany's character herself, and why I think she should go "mad" (though not mad per ce). A lot of posts have already been made about. Hi guys, I am here to ask a few questions about three kingdoms conqueror, pls answer if you know the answer. 1. what are the uses of the flag thingies that was awarded if u complete missions and conquests. 
I always found it kinda weird how literally Game of Thrones take succession law when often times feudal succession law was so flimsy in the first place. When people say things like "Renly has no claim to the throne" I think they're misunderstanding claims. Renly definitely has one, because he's the brother of the king. Not the eldest but he can still use this fact to rally support in order to press that claim, if enough people believe it. Might makes right in feudal society. #Claims William. 3 Kingdoms Conqueror. 629 likes. We Conquer all country within I used to be an avid YA reader in 2015-2016.

I posted this in /asoiaf and it was very controversial. I think it's important to actually read the quotes from the Book of Revelation below. Remember almost the entire book is quoted. It can't be a coincidence that so much is so similar. It's a long read, but it's worth it. Also keep in mind that George Martin loves to tell stories where the "enemy is just the hero of the other side" and to make us understand that the ones we tend to root for (Dany, Jon) might not be the "good guys" after.
