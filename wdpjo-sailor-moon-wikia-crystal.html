I AM SO BEYOND EXCITED FOR SAILOR MOON CRYSTAL!!! It feels like I am a little kid again, getting out of school to go watch Sailor Moon and Dragonball. The 4 Heavenly Kings or Shitennou (四天王) are the first Serious Enemies in the Sailor Moon Universe that battled the Sailor Senshi. They used to be the ones to serve under Prince Endymion of Earth, back when the Earth was united, but were turned against them by the Evil Sorceress Beryl (https://gallery.missdream.org/albums/scanlation_smoon/smoon_act09/023.jpg) Their names are Jadeite (http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/sailormoon/images/a/a2/C_jadeite.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20091005115705). I don't know if anyone else here has seen this new show on Cartoon Network, but it's the first CN show with a female creator (that it took so long is a bit shameful, but we'll move on). Anyway, the main character of the show is a young boy named Steven, who is part of a team of "Crystal Gems", a group of three "action girl" type characters. In and of itself, I really enjoy this show. The stories and style are adorably simple (but not dumbed down), the music is great Hey all! My name is Braxton Wilkinson, and I’m a highschool student. I’ve been playing D&D for nearly two years now. These are bullet pointed notes of what has happened in the game I am DMing thus far, a game that is about to hit it’s one year. I thought some of you might be interested to see what's going on in another person's game. Because I only started taking notes halfway through, and had to go back and fill stuff in by memory, some details in the first I posted this on r/DnD once before, but barely anyone saw it because I put it up in the middle of the night. My players convinced me to put it up again, so here ya go! Hey all! I’ve been playing D&D for nearly two years now.

Okay, so I'm making earrings using this Sailor Moon broach: I'm using five beads, the center being cross drilled, and head pins. I don't want a loop on the side of the earring. I've tried using two head pins and twisting them just between the beads but that hasn't been successful so far. Is there a bette. </p>
